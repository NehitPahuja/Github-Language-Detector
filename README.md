# GitHub Language Detector Dashboard

A single-page dashboard that showcases GitHub repository language statistics with a Spotify-inspired user interface. The app preserves the original behavior of accepting a GitHub username, fetching the most-used languages, and visualizing the breakdown through progress bars and language badges.

## Features
- **Spotify-style layout** featuring a sidebar, hero banner, and dark glass panels for language analytics.
- **Live GitHub lookup** that retrieves the most-used languages for a given user through the GitHub API.
- **Language breakdown visualization** using animated progress bars and color-coded badges.
- **Responsive design** that adapts the dashboard for desktop, tablet, and mobile viewports.

## Getting Started
This project is a static site and does not require a build step.

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Github-Language-Detector.git
   cd Github-Language-Detector
   ```
2. Open `index.html` in your preferred browser. No additional tooling is required.

## Usage
1. Enter a GitHub username in the input field.
2. Click **Generate Card** to fetch repositories for that user.
3. The dashboard updates with total repository count, a dominant language summary, and a percentage breakdown for each detected language.

## Project Structure
- `index.html` – Contains the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that power the Spotify-themed dashboard and language detection logic.
